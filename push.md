git push uploads all local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch.
git push updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository. You can also think of git push as update or publish.

After you make and commit changes locally, you can share them with the remote repository using git push. Pushing changes to the remote makes your commits accessible to others who you may be collaborating with. This will also update any open pull requests with the branch that you're working on.
As best practice, it's important to run the git pull command before you push any new changes to the remote branch. This will update your local branch with any new changes that may have been pushed to the remote from other contributors. Pulling before you push can reduce the amount of merge conflicts you create on GitHub - allowing you to resolve them locally before pushing your changes to the remote branch.
Check what branch you are currently on with git status. If you are working on a protected branch, like main, you may be unable to push commits directly to the remote. If this happens to you, it's OK! You can fix this a few ways.
Work was not yet on any branch
Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: git checkout -b [branchname]
Then, push the new branch up to the remote: git push -u origin [branchname]
Accidentally committed to the wrong branch
Checkout to the branch that you intended to commit to: git checkout [branchname]
Merge the commits from the branch that you did accidentally commit to: git merge [main]
Push your changes to the remote: git push
